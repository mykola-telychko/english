                <h3>Dialog 2 </h3>
                <p>Sure! Here's a pre-intermediate level dialogue between two people about a web developer interview:
                <br> <br>
                <strong>Alice:</strong> Hi Tom! How did your interview for the web developer position go?
                <br>
                <strong>Tom:</strong> Hey Alice! It went okay, I guess. They asked me a lot of questions about my experience with HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <strong>Alice:</strong> That sounds challenging. How did you answer them?
                <br>
                <strong>Tom:</strong> I tried my best to explain my previous projects and how I used HTML and CSS to create websites. But I think I stumbled on a few questions.
                </p>
                <strong>Alice:</strong> Don't worry, Tom. Interviews can be nerve-wracking. Did they mention when you'll hear back from them?
                <br>
                <strong>Tom:</strong> They said they'd let me know by the end of the week. Fingers crossed!
                </p>
                <strong>Alice:</strong> Good luck, Tom! I'm sure you did better than you think.
                <br>
                <strong>Tom:</strong> Sure, here's the continuation: Thanks, Alice! I hope so too. How about you? How's your job hunt going?

                <br>
                <strong>Tom:</strong> I'll keep my fingers crossed for you too, Alice. I have a good feeling about it. And hey, even if it doesn't work out, I'm sure another opportunity will come your way soon.
                </p>
                <strong>Alice:</strong> Thanks, Tom. I appreciate the encouragement. It's nice to have friends like you who always have my back.
                <br>
                <strong>Tom:</strong> Likewise, Alice. We'll both land our dream jobs eventually, I'm sure of it.

                </p>
                <strong>Alice:</strong> Absolutely! Now, let's tackle those job hunts together and celebrate our successes along the way.
                <br>
                <strong>Tom:</strong>  Agreed. To new opportunities and exciting adventures ahead!

                <br>
                <strong>Tom:</strong> You know, Alice, while I was preparing for my interview, they asked about my experience with different types of databases. Have you ever worked with MySQL or MongoDB?
                </p>
                <strong>Alice:</strong>  Actually, I have some experience with MySQL. I used it for a project in my database management course during college. It's great for relational data, but I've heard MongoDB is better for handling unstructured data.
                <br>

                <strong>Alice:</strong> Yeah, and speaking of databases, have you ever heard of ClickHouse? I stumbled upon it while researching columnar databases for a project I'm working on.
                <br>
                <strong>Tom:</strong> ClickHouse? No, I haven't heard of it. What's it all about?
                </p>
                <strong>Alice:</strong> Well, from what I gather, ClickHouse is designed for analytics workloads, especially those involving large volumes of data. It's known for its high performance and efficient storage of columnar data.
                <br>

                </p>
                <strong>Alice:</strong> That sounds like a fantastic idea, Tom! I'm always up for learning something new and tackling challenges together. Let's make it happen!
                <br>
