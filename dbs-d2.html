    <!-- <h3>Dialog 2 </h3> -->
    <p>Sure! Here's a pre-intermediate level dialogue between two people about a web developer interview:</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> Hi Tom! How did your interview for the web developer position go?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><span style="color: red;">Tom:</span></strong> Hey Alice! It went okay, I guess. They asked me a lot of questions about my experience with HTML and CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> That sounds challenging. How did you answer them?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><span style="color: red;">Tom:</span></strong> I tried my best to explain my previous projects and how I used HTML and CSS to create websites. But I think I stumbled on a few questions.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> Don't worry, Tom. Interviews can be nerve-wracking. Did they mention when you'll hear back from them?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><span style="color: red;">Tom:</span></strong> They said they'd let me know by the end of the week. Fingers crossed!
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> Good luck, Tom! I'm sure you did better than you think.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><span style="color: red;">Tom:</span></strong> Thanks, Alice! I hope so too. How about you? How's your job hunt going?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> It's been a bit slow, to be honest. I've been applying to various graphic design positions, but haven't heard back from many yet.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><span style="color: red;">Tom:</span></strong> Hang in there, Alice. The right opportunity will come along soon. Have you considered brushing up on any new skills to boost your chances?

    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> Thanks, Tom! I'll definitely look into it. By the way, did they mention anything about the company culture during your interview?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><span style="color: red;">Tom:</span></strong> Yeah, they mentioned they have a pretty laid-back atmosphere, which sounds like a good fit for me. They also emphasized the importance of collaboration and creativity in their projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> That sounds promising. I'll keep my fingers crossed for you, Tom. Let me know as soon as you hear back from them!
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><span style="color: red;">Tom:</span></strong> Will do, Alice. And thanks again for the support.

    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> Definitely! Plus, it's always nice to connect with others who share similar interests. Let me know if you decide to go, maybe I'll tag along.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><span style="color: red;">Tom:</span></strong> Will do, Alice. It would be great to have you there. By the way, have you heard back from that design agency you interviewed with last week?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> Not yet, but I'm hoping to hear back soon. I felt pretty good about the interview, so fingers crossed.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><span style="color: red;">Tom:</span></strong> I'll keep my fingers crossed for you too, Alice. I have a good feeling about it. And hey, even if it doesn't work out, I'm sure another opportunity will come your way soon.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> Thanks, Tom. I appreciate the encouragement. It's nice to have friends like you who always have my back.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tom:</strong style="color: blue;"> Likewise, Alice. We'll both land our dream jobs eventually, I'm sure of it.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> Here's hoping! And hey, if you ever need a second pair of eyes on your code or want to bounce ideas off someone, you know where to find me.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tom:</strong style="color: blue;"> Thanks, Alice. I'll definitely take you up on that offer. We make a great team.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> Absolutely! Now, let's tackle those job hunts together and celebrate our successes along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tom:</strong style="color: blue;"> Agreed. To new opportunities and exciting adventures ahead!
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> Cheers to that, Tom!
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tom:</strong style="color: blue;"> You know, Alice, while I was preparing for my interview, they asked about my experience with different types of databases. Have you ever worked with MySQL or MongoDB?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> Actually, I have some experience with MySQL. I used it for a project in my database management course during college. It's great for relational data, but I've heard MongoDB is better for handling unstructured data.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tom:</strong> That's interesting. I've mainly worked with MySQL too, but I've been curious about MongoDB. They say it's really flexible and scalable, especially for applications with constantly changing data requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> Yeah, and speaking of databases, have you ever heard of ClickHouse? I stumbled upon it while researching columnar databases for a project I'm working on.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tom:</strong> ClickHouse? No, I haven't heard of it. What's it all about?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> Well, from what I gather, ClickHouse is designed for analytics workloads, especially those involving large volumes of data. It's known for its high performance and efficient storage of columnar data.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tom:</strong> Wow, that sounds impressive. I'll have to look into it more. It could be useful for some of the projects I'm working on that require heavy data analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> Definitely! It might be worth exploring, especially if you're dealing with big data scenarios. Let me know if you need any resources or want to dive deeper into it.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tom:</strong> Thanks, Alice. I appreciate it. And hey, maybe we could even collaborate on a project together that incorporates some of these database technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> That sounds like a fantastic idea, Tom! I'm always up for learning something new and tackling challenges together. Let's make it happen!
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tom:</strong> Absolutely! To new discoveries and exciting collaborations ahead!
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> Cheers to that, Tom!
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tom:</strong> You know, Alice, exploring new database technologies like MongoDB and ClickHouse got me thinking about the future of data management. With the rise of big data and the Internet of Things, having efficient and scalable databases is becoming more crucial than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> I couldn't agree more, Tom. It's amazing how much data we generate every day, and having the right tools to store, analyze, and extract insights from that data is essential for businesses to stay competitive.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tom:</strong> Exactly! And it's not just about storing data anymore. It's also about being able to quickly access and process it to make informed decisions in real-time. That's where technologies like ClickHouse and MongoDB shine.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> Absolutely. And as developers, it's important for us to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in database technologies and continuously expand our skill sets to meet the evolving needs of the industry.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tom:</strong> Totally agree, Alice. It's an exciting time to be in the field of data management and analytics. Who knows what innovative solutions and breakthroughs lie ahead as we push the boundaries of what's possible with data?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> The possibilities are endless, Tom. And with our passion for learning and exploring new technologies, I have no doubt that we'll be at the forefront of shaping the future of data-driven applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tom:</strong> Here's to embracing the future of data and embarking on this journey together, Alice. I'm grateful to have a colleague like you who shares my enthusiasm for pushing the boundaries of technology.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tom:</strong> No way! I crushed it at soccer Saturday – our team won 4-2 but dude, I could barely walk after! Then Sunday, Sarah dragged me to that new Marvel movie. Way better than I expected!
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> Ooooh right! Was it the one with the multiverse thing? I’ve been dying to see it!
