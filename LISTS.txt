Kennedy inspired a generation with his call to public service: "Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country," launching the idealism of the 1960s.
Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" (1963)
While not a president, King's speech at the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington became foundational to American civil rights rhetoric and influenced presidential discourse ever after.

The "Day of Infamy" speech following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor galvanized American resolve and led to the U.S. entry into World War II.
George W. Bush's "Bullhorn Address" (2001)

Theodore Roosevelt's "The Man with the Muck-Rake" (1906)
This speech coined a term for investigative journalists and helped define the Progressive Era's approach to corruption and reform.
Lyndon B. Johnson's "We Shall Overcome" (1965)
