                <h3>Dialog 8. The Israel-Palestine conflict</h3>

                <p>
                    <strong>The Israel-Palestine conflict</strong>is a long-standing and deeply complex conflict with roots going back over a century. 
                    Below are some key moments that have significantly shaped the course of this conflict: 
                    <br>
                    
                    <h4>1. Late 19th and Early 20th Century: Zionist Movement and Arab Nationalism</h4>

                    <strong>Zionist Movement:</strong> The modern Zionist movement began in Europe in the late 19th century, advocating 
                    for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, which was then part of the Ottoman Empire. 
                    This movement was a response to rising anti-Semitism in Europe. 
                    </p>
                    <strong>Arab Nationalism:</strong> At the same time, Arab nationalism was growing among the Arab population in 
                    Palestine and the wider Middle East, seeking independence from Ottoman and later European colonial 
                    rule.
                    <br>
                   
                    <h4>2. 1917: Balfour Declaration </h4>
                    <strong>The Balfour Declaration</strong>  was a statement by the British government expressing support for "the 
                    establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people," while also stating that nothing 
                    should be done to harm the rights of existing non-Jewish communities. This created tensions between 
                    Jews and Arabs in Palestine. 
                    <br>

                    <h4>3. 1947: UN Partition Plan  </h4>
                    <strong>After World War II</strong>  and the Holocaust, international support for a Jewish state increased. The United 
                    Nations proposed a partition plan to divide Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, with 
                    Jerusalem under international control. The Jewish community accepted the plan, but the Arab 
                    community rejected it
                    <br>
                    
                    <h4>4. 1948: Creation of Israel and First Arab-Israeli War  </h4>
                    <strong>On May 14, 1948,</strong> 
                    <span style="color: red;">  Israel declared independence. The next day, neighboring Arab states (Egypt, Jordan, 
                        Syria, and Iraq) invaded, leading to the First Arab-Israeli War. Israel won the war and expanded its 
                        territory beyond the UN partition plan. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were expelled from 
                        their homes, an event Palestinians refer to as the "Nakba" (catastrophe).

                    <h4>5. 1967: Six-Day War </h4>
                    <strong>In June 1967,</strong> tensions between Israel and its neighbors escalated into the Six-Day War. Israel defeated 
                    the combined forces of Egypt, Jordan, and Syria and captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip, East 
                    Jerusalem, the Sinai Peninsula, and the Golan Heights. The war drastically changed the map of the 
                    region and increased the number of Palestinian refugees.
                    <br>

                    <h4>6. 1987-1993: First Intifada </h4>
                    <strong>The First Intifada</strong> was a Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza. It 
                    was marked by widespread protests, civil disobedience, and violence. The uprising led to increased 
                    international attention and set the stage for the Oslo Accords.
