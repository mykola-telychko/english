                    <h3 style="color: red">About this speech</h3>
                    <h4>Historical Context</h4>
                    The "Day of Infamy" speech following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor galvanized American resolve and led to the U.S. entry into World War II.
Franklin D. Roosevelt's **"Pearl Harbor Address to the Nation"** (December 8, 1941) is one of the most famous speeches in American history, 
delivered in response to Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on **December 7, 1941**. Here’s the **historical context** behind the speech:

### **1. Background: U.S.-Japan Relations Before the Attack**
- **Tensions Rising**: By the late 1930s and early 1940s, Japan was aggressively expanding its empire in Asia (invading China in 1937,
 occupying French Indochina in 1940–41). The U.S. opposed these actions and imposed **economic sanctions**, including an **oil embargo** (July 1941), 
 crippling Japan’s military operations.
- **Failed Diplomacy**: Negotiations between the U.S. and Japan stalled as Japan refused to withdraw from China and Southeast Asia. 
The U.S. demanded Japan halt its expansion, but Japan saw war as inevitable.

### **2. The Attack on Pearl Harbor (Dec. 7, 1941)**
- **Surprise Military Strike**: Japan launched a **devastating aerial attack** on the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, killing **2,403 Americans**,
 sinking or damaging **19 ships**, and destroying **188 aircraft**.
- **Strategic Goal**: Japan hoped to **cripple the U.S. Navy** to prevent American interference in its conquests across Asia and the Pacific.
- **A Day of Infamy**: Roosevelt famously called December 7, 1941, **"a date which will live in infamy."**

### **3. Roosevelt’s Speech (Dec. 8, 1941)**
- **Purpose**: To inform Congress and the American people of the attack and **ask for a declaration of war** against Japan.
- **Key Quotes**:
  - *"Yesterday, December 7, 1941—a date which will live in infamy—the United States was suddenly and deliberately attacked..."*
  - *"No matter how long it may take us... the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory."*
- **Impact**: The speech lasted **just over 7 minutes**, but it unified the nation. Congress approved a **declaration of war** within **an hour**, 
with only **one dissenting vote** (Rep. Jeannette Rankin, a pacifist).

### **4. Aftermath & Entry into World War II**
- **U.S. Joins WWII**: The attack ended American isolationism. On **December 11, 1941**, Germany and Italy (Japan’s Axis allies) declared war on the U.S.,
 bringing America fully into **World War II**.
- **Mobilization**: The U.S. rapidly expanded its military and industrial production, becoming the **"Arsenal of Democracy."**
- **Turning Point**: The war shifted dramatically with U.S. involvement, leading to Allied victories in Europe (1944–45) and the Pacific 
(atomic bombs on Hiroshima & Nagasaki, 1945).

### **5. Why the Speech Matters**
- **Rhetorical Masterpiece**: Roosevelt’s speech was **short, powerful, and emotionally compelling**, designed to **rally the nation**.
- **End of Isolationism**: Marked the end of U.S. neutrality and its emergence as a **global superpower**.
- **Legacy**: The phrase **"a date which will live in infamy"** remains iconic, symbolizing America’s resolve in the face of treachery.

### **Conclusion**
Roosevelt’s Pearl Harbor speech was a defining moment in U.S. history, transforming public opinion and thrusting America into **World War II**,
 ultimately shaping the **post-war world order**. The attack and the speech remain deeply embedded in **American memory** as a call to unity and resilience.

                    <h3 style="color: red">Franklin D. Roosevelt: A Complete Biography</h3>
                    I can provide you with a comprehensive overview of Franklin D. Roosevelt's life and presidency. FDR was one of America's most significant 
                    presidents, serving longer than any other president in U.S. history.
<br>
<h4>Early Life and Background (1882-1910)</h4>

Franklin Delano Roosevelt was born on January 30, 1882, into a wealthy family in Hyde Park, New York. He was the only child of James Roosevelt and 
Sara Delano Roosevelt. His privileged upbringing included private tutoring, European travel, and education at elite institutions.

Roosevelt attended Groton School, a prestigious preparatory school, where he was influenced by the headmaster Endicott Peabody's emphasis on public service.
 He then went to Harvard University, where he was an average student but active in extracurricular activities, serving as editor of the Harvard Crimson newspaper.

In 1905, he married Eleanor Roosevelt, his fifth cousin once removed and the niece of President Theodore Roosevelt. Theodore Roosevelt gave 
Eleanor away at the wedding, and his presence somewhat overshadowed the groom. Franklin and Eleanor had six children together, though one died in infancy.

<h4>Early Politics and Naval Service (1910-1920)</h4>

Roosevelt's political career began in 1910 when he was elected to the New York State Senate as a Democrat. He quickly gained attention for his 
opposition to the Tammany Hall political machine and his support for progressive reforms.

In 1913, President Woodrow Wilson appointed Roosevelt as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, a position he held for seven years during World War I. 
This role gave him valuable experience in government administration and naval affairs, which would prove crucial during World War II.

## The Polio Diagnosis and Personal Transformation (1921-1928)

In 1921, at age 39, Roosevelt contracted what was believed to be polio (though some modern medical experts suggest it may have been Guillain-Barré syndrome).
The illness left him permanently paralyzed from the waist down, though he went to great lengths to hide the extent of his disability from the public.

This period marked a profound personal transformation. Roosevelt spent years in rehabilitation, including time at Warm Springs, Georgia, where he 
eventually established a treatment center for polio patients. His struggle with disability deepened his empathy and determination, while Eleanor emerged
 as his political partner and advocate.

<h4>Governor of New York (1929-1932)</h4>

Despite his physical limitations, Roosevelt returned to politics and was elected Governor of New York in 1928. As governor during the early years
 of the Great Depression, he implemented innovative relief programs that would later influence his New Deal policies. These included unemployment insurance,
  old-age pensions, and public works projects.

His success in New York made him a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1932.

<h4>The Presidential Years (1933-1945)</h4>

<h4> First Term (1933-1937): The New Deal Begins</h4>

Roosevelt won the 1932 election in a landslide against incumbent Herbert Hoover, promising a "New Deal" for the American people. He took office during 
the worst economic crisis in American history, with unemployment at 25% and banks failing nationwide.

His first 100 days were marked by unprecedented legislative activity:
- **Bank Holiday and Banking Reform**: Closed banks temporarily to prevent runs and restore confidence
- **Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC)**: Employed young men in conservation projects
- **Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA)**: Helped farmers by reducing crop surpluses
- **National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA)**: Attempted to regulate industry and guarantee workers' rights
- **Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)**: Brought electricity and development to the rural South

Roosevelt's fireside chats on radio helped restore public confidence and explained his policies directly to the American people.

<h4> Second Term (1937-1941): Expanding the New Deal</h4>

Roosevelt won re-election easily in 1936, carrying every state except Maine and Vermont. His second term saw both achievements and setbacks:

<h4>Major Programs:</h4>
- **Social Security Act (1935)**: Created the modern social safety net
- **Works Progress Administration (WPA)**: Employed millions in public works projects
- **National Labor Relations Act**: Strengthened workers' rights to organize

The Court-Packing Controversy**: Roosevelt's attempt to expand the Supreme Court after it struck down several New Deal programs proved 
politically damaging and ultimately unsuccessful.

<h4> Third and Fourth Terms (1941-1945): World War II </h4>

Roosevelt broke the two-term tradition by running for a third term in 1940, arguing that the world crisis required experienced leadership. 
He won again, though by a smaller margin.

<h5>Pre-War Leadership:</h5>
- Gradually moved America away from isolationism
- Implemented Lend-Lease to aid Britain and allies
- Met with Winston Churchill to plan post-war cooperation

<h5>Wartime President:</h5>
After Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941), Roosevelt led America into World War II. His wartime leadership included:
- Mobilizing American industry for war production
- Making difficult strategic decisions with Allied leaders
- Managing the complex Alliance with Britain and Soviet Union
- Overseeing the Manhattan Project (atomic bomb development)

<h5>Major Wartime Conferences:</h5>
- Casablanca (1943): With Churchill, established "unconditional surrender" policy
- Tehran (1943): First meeting with Stalin and Churchill
- Yalta (1945): Final major conference, addressing post-war Europe and the United Nations

<h4> Personal Life and Character</h4>

Roosevelt was a complex figure whose public persona often masked private struggles:

**Marriage and Family**: His relationship with Eleanor evolved from a traditional Victorian marriage to a political partnership. 
Both had close friendships that may have been romantic relationships with others, but they remained married and politically allied.

**Leadership Style**: Roosevelt was known for his optimism, charm, and political pragmatism. He was willing to experiment with different approaches and wasn't ideologically rigid.

**Relationship with Disability**: He never publicly acknowledged the extent of his paralysis, going to extraordinary lengths to appear able-bodied in public.
 This was partly due to the stigma surrounding disability at the time.

<h4>Major Achievements and Legacy</h4>

**Domestic Policy:**
- Transformed the role of federal government in American life
- Created the modern social safety net
- Established labor rights and regulations
- Restored confidence in American institutions

**Foreign Policy:**
- Led America from isolationism to global leadership
- Helped establish the United Nations
- Managed the Grand Alliance that defeated fascism

**Political Legacy:**
- Realigned American politics, creating the New Deal Coalition
- Redefined the presidency as a more active, visible office
- Established the modern relationship between president and public

## Death and Historical Assessment

Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945, at Warm Springs, Georgia, just months before the end of World War II. He was 63 years old and had served as president for 12 years and 39 days.

**Historical Ranking**: Historians consistently rank Roosevelt among the top three presidents, alongside Washington and Lincoln. 
He is credited with saving democracy during the Great Depression and leading America to victory in World War II.

**Controversies and Criticisms**:
- Japanese-American internment during WWII
- Attempts to pack the Supreme Court
- Expansion of federal power and deficit spending
- Some argue he prolonged the Depression with certain policies

**Enduring Impact**: Roosevelt's presidency fundamentally changed America. The New Deal programs he created form the foundation of the modern welfare state,
 and his leadership style influenced how Americans view the presidency. His belief that government should actively work to improve people's lives remains
  a defining principle of American liberalism.

Franklin D. Roosevelt's life story is one of privilege transformed by adversity into service, personal struggle overcome by public purpose, and leadership
 that helped reshape both America and the world during two of the greatest crises of the 20th century.

        <h3 style="color: red">Transcript </h3>
Mr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives:<br>
Yesterday, December 7th, 1941 -- a date which will live in infamy -- the United States of America was suddenly and 
deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.

The United States was at peace with that nation and, at the solicitation of Japan, was still in conversation with its 
government and its emperor looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific.

Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing in the American island of Oahu, the Japanese ambassador 
to the United States and his colleague delivered to our Secretary of State a formal reply to a recent American message. 
And while this reply stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of war or of armed attack.1

It will be recorded that the distance of Hawaii from Japan makes it obvious that the attack was deliberately planned many 
days or even weeks ago. During the intervening time, the Japanese government has deliberately sought to deceive the United States
by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.

The attack yesterday on the Hawaiian islands has caused severe damage to American naval and military forces. I regret to tell
you that very many American lives have been lost. In addition, American ships have been reported torpedoed on the high seas 
between San Francisco and Honolulu.

Yesterday, the Japanese government also launched an attack against Malaya.
Last night, Japanese forces attacked Hong Kong.
Last night, Japanese forces attacked Guam.
Last night, Japanese forces attacked the Philippine Islands.
Last night, the Japanese attacked Wake Island.
And this morning, the Japanese attacked Midway Island.

Japan has, therefore, undertaken a surprise offensive extending throughout the Pacific area. The facts of yesterday and today speak for themselves.
 The people of the United States have already formed their opinions and well understand the implications to the very life and safety of our nation.

As Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense. But always will our whole nation
remember the character of the onslaught against us.
No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory.
I believe that I interpret the will of the Congress and of the people when I assert that we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost,
but will make it very certain that this form of treachery shall never again endanger us.

Hostilities exist. There is no blinking at the fact that our people, our territory, and our interests are in grave danger.
With confidence in our armed forces, with the unbounding determination of our people, we will gain the inevitable triumph -- so help us God.
I ask that the Congress declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan on Sunday, December 7th, 1941, a state of war has existed
between the United States and the Japanese empire.
