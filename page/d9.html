                    <strong>The Israel-Palestine conflict</strong>is a long-standing and deeply complex conflict with roots going back over a century.

                    <h4>1. Late 19th and Early 20th Century: Zionist Movement and Arab Nationalism</h4>
                        <strong>Zionist Movement:</strong> The modern Zionist movement began in Europe in the late 19th century, advocating 
                        for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, which was then part of the Ottoman Empire. 
                        This movement was a response to rising anti-Semitism in Europe. 
                        </p>
                        <strong>Arab Nationalism:</strong> At the same time, Arab nationalism was growing among the Arab population in 
                        Palestine and the wider Middle East, seeking independence from Ottoman and later European colonial 
                        rule.
