                    <h4>Analysis of George Washingtonâ€™s Speech (November 19, 1863)</h4>
                    Source National Archives (speech from https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/november-19-1863-gettysburg-address)
                    Four months after the Battle of Gettysburg,
                    Lincoln joined in a dedication of a national cemetery on a portion of the battlefield. 
                    The speech he delivered that day would become one of the most famous speeches given by a U.S. President.

                    Desire for Peace with France
                    
                    Washington emphasized the importance of maintaining peaceful relations with France, despite diplomatic tensions.
                    This was crucial given the backdrop of the French Revolution and the growing rift between Federalists (who leaned pro-British) and Democratic-Republicans (who sympathized with France).
                    His stance aligned with his broader foreign policy of neutrality, as seen in his Farewell Address and the Proclamation of Neutrality (1793).
                    Economic Protectionism & Commerce<br><br>
                    
                    Washington proposed a national law to safeguard American commerce, reflecting concerns over international trade and maritime security.
                    This suggests an early recognition of the need for strong economic policies to protect U.S. interests, laying the foundation for future policies like protective tariffs and the American System (advocated later by Henry Clay).
                    Strengthening the Federal Government<br><br>
                    
                    He put forward recommendations for strengthening federal institutions, indicating a belief in a strong central authority.
                    This aligns with Federalist ideals, countering the fears of Anti-Federalists who worried about government overreach.
                    His proposals foreshadowed future debates over state vs. federal power, which would later fuel tensions leading to events like the Civil War.
