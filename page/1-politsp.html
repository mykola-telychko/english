        <h4> Historical Context</h4>
        John F. Kennedy’s Inaugural Address, delivered on January 20, 1961, is one of the most 
        famous speeches in American history. It came at a critical moment in U.S. and world history, 
        shaped by the Cold War, nuclear tensions, and global ideological struggles. 
        Here’s the historical context behind the speech:<br><br>

        1. The Cold War & U.S.-Soviet Rivalry<br>
        The U.S. and Soviet Union were locked in a tense Cold War, with the threat of nuclear 
        conflict looming after events like the Berlin Blockade (1948-49), the Korean War (1950-53),
        and the Hungarian Revolution (1956).
        The Cuban Revolution (1959) had just brought Fidel Castro to power, aligning Cuba
        with the Soviet Union—a major concern for the U.S.
        The Space Race was heating up after the USSR launched Sputnik (1957) and 
        Yuri Gagarin’s orbit (1961), raising fears of Soviet technological superiority.<br><br>
        
        2. Kennedy’s Election & the "New Frontier"<br>
        Kennedy, a young (43) and charismatic leader, narrowly defeated Richard Nixon in the 1960 election, 
        promising a new era of American leadership.
        His campaign emphasized vigor, idealism, and Cold War toughness, contrasting with the more cautious Eisenhower era.
        The U.S. faced challenges like economic stagnation, racial tensions, and global decolonization movements, 
        where newly independent nations were choosing between democracy and communism.<br><br>
        
        3. Key Themes of the Inaugural Address<br>
        Kennedy’s speech was crafted to inspire Americans and signal strength to the world. Key lines and themes include:
        "Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country." (Call for civic duty)
        "The torch has been passed to a new generation." (Emphasizing youth and change)
        "We shall pay any price, bear any burden… to assure the survival and success of liberty." (Cold War resolve)
        "Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate." (Balancing strength & diplomacy)
        A call for unity between adversaries, including the famous line: "Let us explore the stars together…"<br><br>
        
        4. Immediate & Long-Term Impact<br>
        The speech set the tone for Kennedy’s presidency, which included the Bay of Pigs (1961), 
        the Cuban Missile Crisis (1962), the Peace Corps, and the space program’s push to the moon.
        It became a defining moment in Cold War rhetoric, framing the U.S. as a defender of freedom against Soviet expansion.
        Kennedy’s assassination (1963) cemented his legacy, and the speech remains a symbol of American idealism and Cold War determination.

        <h4 style="color: red">Transcript</h4>
        Vice President Johnson, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, President Eisenhower, Vice President Nixon, President Truman, Reverend Clergy, fellow citizens:<br><br>

        We observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom—symbolizing an end as well as a beginning—signifying
        renewal as well as change. For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forebears prescribed
        nearly a century and three quarters ago.<br><br>
        The world is very different now. For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all
        forms of human life. And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe—the 
        belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God.<br><br>
        We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution. Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend
        and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans—born in this century, tempered by war,
         disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage—and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing 
         of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world.
        Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, 
        support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.
        This much we pledge—and more.<br><br>
        To those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share, we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends. United, 
        there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperative ventures. Divided, there is little we can do—for 
        we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split asunder.<br><br>
        To those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free, we pledge our word that one form of colonial control
        shall not have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny. We shall not always expect to find 
        them supporting our view. But we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own' freedom—and to remember that,
        in the past, those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside.<br><br>
        To those peoples in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best
        efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required—not because the communists may be doing it,
        not because we seek their votes, but because it is right. If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, 
        it cannot save the few who are rich.<br><br>
        To our sister republics south of our border, we offer a special pledge—to convert our good words into good deeds—in
        a new alliance for progress—to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of poverty. 
        But this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of hostile powers. Let all our neighbors know that 
        we shall join with them to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the Americas. And let every other power 
        know that this Hemisphere intends to remain the master of its own house.<br><br>
        To that world assembly of sovereign states, the United Nations, our last best hope in an age where the instruments
        of war have far outpaced the instruments of peace, we renew our pledge of support—to prevent it from becoming
        merely a forum for invective—to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak—and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run.
        Finally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversary, we offer not a pledge but a request: that both
        sides begin anew the quest for peace, before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all 
        humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction.<br><br>
        We dare not tempt them with weakness. For only when our arms are sufficient, beyond doubt can we be certain beyond
        doubt that they will never be employed.
        But neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course—both sides overburdened
        by the cost of modern weapons, both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing to 
        alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind's final war.<br><br>
        So let us begin anew—remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always 
        subject to proof. Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.<br><br>
        Let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us.
        Let both sides, for the first time, formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and control of 
        arms—and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all nations.
        Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors. Together let us explore the stars, 
        conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths and encourage the arts and commerce.
        Let both sides unite to heed in all corners of the earth the command of Isaiah—to "undo the heavy burdens . . . 
        (and) let the oppressed go free."<br><br>
        And if a beach-head of cooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion, let both sides join in creating a new endeavor,
        not a new balance of power, but a new world of law, where the strong are just and the weak secure and the peace preserved.
        All this will not be finished in the first one hundred days. Nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days,
        nor in the life of this Administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. But let us begin.
        In your hands, my fellow citizens, more than mine, will rest the final success or failure of our course. 
        Since this country was founded, each generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty.
        The graves of young Americans who answered the call to service surround the globe.<br><br>
        Now the trumpet summons us again—not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need—not as a call to battle, 
        though embattled we are—but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out,
        "rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation"—a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty,
        disease and war itself.<br><br>
        Can we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance, North and South, East and West, 
        that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind? Will you join in that historic effort?
        In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom
        in its hour of maximum danger. I do not shrink from this responsibility—I welcome it. I do not believe 
        that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation. The energy, the faith,
        the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it—and the glow 
        from that fire can truly light the world.<br><br>
        And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.
        My fellow citizens of the world: ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man.
        Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us here the same high standards
        of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you. With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the
        final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing and His help, 
        but knowing that here on earth God's work must truly be our own.<br><br>
