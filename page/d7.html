                <p>
                <strong>Interviewer</strong> Thank you for taking the time to meet with us today. Let’s start with your 
                experience. Can you tell me about a complex Angular project you’ve worked on and what 
                your role was in it?
                <br>
                <strong>Candidate:</strong> Certainly. In my previous role at [Company], I led the development of a 
                large-scale single-page application (SPA) for [Industry]. My responsibilities included: 
                </p>
                <strong>Architecting</strong> the overall application structure using Angular's component-based 
                approach.
                <br>
                <strong>Implementing</strong> complex features such as [Feature 1], [Feature 2], and [Feature 3].
                <br>
                <strong>Optimizing</strong> the application for performance and scalability to handle a large number 
                of users.
                <br>
                <strong>Mentoring</strong> 
                   <span style="color: red;"> junior developers and conducting code reviews.
                </span> 
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Interviewer</strong> Can you elaborate on the challenges you faced during this project and how you 
                    overcame them?
                    <br>
                    <strong>Candidate:</strong> One of the biggest challenges was integrating our Angular application with a 
                    legacy backend system. To address this, we created a custom API layer using [Technology] 
                    to abstract away the complexities of the backend. We also implemented a robust caching 
                    strategy to improve performance. 
                    </p>
                    <strong>Interviewer:</strong> Can you explain your understanding of Angular's change detection and how 
                    you optimize it for performance? 
                    <br>
                    <strong>Candidate:</strong> 
                       <span style="color: red;"> Angular's change detection is a powerful mechanism, but it can also be a 
                        performance bottleneck if not used carefully. I have a deep understanding of Angular's 
                        change detection strategies, including OnPush and change detection zones. For example, in 
                        our project, we used OnPush change detection for components that rarely changed, and we 
                        minimized the number of expressions within templates to reduce the amount of work done 
                        by the change detector.
