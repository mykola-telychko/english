                <strong>Sarah (Project Manager):</strong> Alright, team, let’s start by reviewing our project timelines. We’ve committed to delivering the MVP in 6 weeks. Tom, how’s the progress on the backend? Can we stay on track?
                <br>
                <strong>Tom (Software Developer):</strong>  The backend is about 60% done. I’ve hit a couple of blockers with integrating the third-party API. We’re still missing some documentation, and their response time isn’t the best. If this drags on, it could push our timeline by a week or so.
                </p>
                <strong>Sarah:</strong> That’s not ideal. Can you estimate how much time you’ll need once the API issue is resolved?
                <br>
                <strong>Tom:</strong> 
                   <span style="color: red;"> Assuming they get back to us this week, I’ll need another two days to finalize the integration. After that, I’ll start working on the authentication module, which should take about four more days. But if there’s further delay with the API, we’re looking at potentially a week’s delay.
                </span> 
                </p>

            

                <strong>Sarah:</strong>  It sounds like each platform has its strengths, but switching completely might not be the best move right now. Let’s stick with AWS for the core infrastructure and services, but we’ll keep an eye on Google Cloud for data analytics and machine learning down the line. If Azure becomes more relevant to the clients we’re working with, we’ll explore that too.
                <br>
                <strong>Tom:</strong> That makes sense. If we do expand into multi-cloud, we can start small—maybe just using Google Cloud for analytics as a test case. That way, we’re not overloading ourselves with too much complexity at once.
                </p>
                <strong>Alice:</strong> Agreed. I’m happy to explore integrating other platforms, but we should make sure the ROI is worth the effort. Right now, AWS is working fine for most of our needs.
                <br>
                <strong>John:</strong> 
                   <span style="color: red;"> AWS has been solid, but I agree with keeping options open. If we start handling big data or AI, we’ll need to reconsider our cloud strategy. We can also monitor pricing. Sometimes Google Cloud and Azure offer competitive pricing compared to AWS, depending on the services we need.
                </span> 
                </p>

                <strong>Sarah:</strong> Good points all around. We’ll continue to evaluate as the project grows. I’ll make a note to reassess our cloud needs in the next phase. For now, we’ll focus on optimizing AWS and keeping track of the trends in Google Cloud and Azure. Thanks, everyone, for your input!
                <br>
                <strong>In this</strong> In this continuation, the team discusses the strengths and weaknesses of AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, considering the possibility of adopting a multi-cloud strategy while focusing on current project details and future scalability options.
