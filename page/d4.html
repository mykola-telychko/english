                <h3>Planning dialogue </h3>

                <strong>Tom:</strong> Hey, Lisa! How was your weekend?
                <br>
                <strong>Lisa:</strong> 
                   <span style="color: red;"> Hey, Tom! It was really good, thanks! On Saturday, I went hiking, and on Sunday, I just chilled at home. How about you?
                </span> 
                </p>
                <strong>Tom:</strong> Sounds awesome! I played soccer on Saturday and caught a movie on Sunday. Oh, by the way, did you hear about the party next Friday?
                <br>
                <strong>Lisa:</strong> Yeah, I did! I’m totally going. Oh, and don’t forget, we’ve got that meeting on Wednesday.
                </p>
                <strong>Tom:</strong> Oh, right! Thanks for reminding me. So, Monday for the meeting and Friday for the party. Looks like a busy week ahead!
                <br>
                <strong>Lisa:</strong> Tell me about it! I’ve got a ton of work to finish before the meeting too.
                </p>
                <strong>Tom:</strong> Same here. I’m still working on that report. It’s taking forever.
                <br>
                <strong>Lisa:</strong> Ugh, I feel you. I just need to review mine one more time. I’ll have it ready by tomorrow, though.
                </p>
                <strong>Tom:</strong> Perfect. What about Tuesday? Anything exciting planned?
                <br>
                <strong>Lisa:</strong>  Not really, just the usual work grind. But on Wednesday evening, I’m meeting some friends for dinner.
                </p>
                <strong>Tom:</strong> That sounds fun! I might join you guys if I can wrap things up early. What about Thursday?
                <br>
                <strong>Lisa:</strong> I’ve got a dentist appointment in the morning, but nothing else after that. What about you?
                </p>
                <strong>Tom:</strong> Just some errands during the day, but I’m free in the evening. Maybe we could grab dinner together?
                <br>
                <strong>Lisa:</strong> That sounds great! Let’s plan for Thursday then.
                </p>
                <strong>Tom:</strong> Awesome. So, dinner on Thursday and the meeting on Monday. Anything else we need to remember?
                <br>
                <strong>Lisa:</strong> I don’t think so, but I’ll double-check my calendar just to be sure.
                </p>
                <strong>Tom:</strong> Good idea. Well, I should probably get back to that report. Catch you later, Lisa!
                <br>
                <strong>Lisa:</strong> Bye, Tom! Good luck with the report!
                </p>
                <strong>Tom:</strong> Before i forget. Have you made plans for next months? 
                <br>
                <strong>Lisa:</strong> Not yet, what's happening?
                </p>
                <strong>Tom:</strong> Well, I was thinking of organizing a weekend getaway towards the end of May.
                <br>
                <strong>Lisa:</strong> That sounds amazing! Where are you thinking of going?
                </p>
                <strong>Tom:</strong> I was thinking of renting a cabin up in the mountains. It would be a nice break from the city.
                <br>
                <strong>Lisa:</strong> Count me in! Let me check my calendar to see which weekend works best.
                </p>
                <strong>Tom:</strong>  Sure, take your time. Oh, and speaking of dates, did you remember that our friend's birthday is coming up on the 15th of April?
                <br>
                <strong>Lisa:</strong> Yes, I have it marked down. We should plan something special for them.
                </p>
                <strong>Tom:</strong> Definitely. Maybe we could throw a small party or organize a dinner.
                <br>
                <strong>Lisa:</strong>Sounds like a plan. I'll start coordinating with the rest of the group.
                </p>
                <strong>Tom:</strong> Great. And don't forget about your dentist appointment on the 28th of this month.
                <br>
                <strong>Lisa:</strong> Thanks for the reminder. I'll make sure not to double-book myself.
                </p>
                <strong>Tom:</strong> No problem. It's always good to stay organized, especially with busy schedules like ours.
                <br>
                <strong>Lisa:</strong> Absolutely. Well, I'll let you get back to work on that report. Talk to you later, Tom!
                </p>
                <strong>Tom:</strong> Talk to you later, Lisa!
